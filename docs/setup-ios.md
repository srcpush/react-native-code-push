## iOS Setup

Once you've acquired the Source Push plugin, you need to integrate it into the Xcode project of your React Native app and configure it correctly. To do this, take the following steps:

### Plugin Installation and Configuration for React Native 0.76 version and above (iOS)

1. Run `cd ios && pod install && cd ..` to install all the necessary CocoaPods dependencies.

2. Change bundleUrl on AppDelegate file.

   **If you're using objective-c:**
   1. Open up the `AppDelegate.m` file, and add an import statement for the Source Push headers:

            ```objective-c
            #import <CodePush/CodePush.h>
            ```

   2. Find the following line of code, which sets the source URL for bridge for production releases:

      ```objective-c
      return [[NSBundle mainBundle] URLForResource:@"main" withExtension:@"jsbundle"];
      ```

   3. Replace it with this line:

      ```objective-c
      return [CodePush bundleURL];
      ```

      This change configures your app to always load the most recent version of your app's JS bundle. On the first launch, this will correspond to the file that was compiled with the app. However, after an update has been pushed via Source Push, this will return the location of the most recently installed update.

      *NOTE: The `bundleURL` method assumes your app's JS bundle is named `main.jsbundle`. If you have configured your app to use a different file name, simply call the `bundleURLForResource:` method (which assumes you're using the `.jsbundle` extension) or `bundleURLForResource:withExtension:` method instead, in order to overwrite that default behavior*

      Typically, you're only going to want to use Source Push to resolve your JS bundle location within release builds, and therefore, we recommend using the `DEBUG` pre-processor macro to dynamically switch between using the packager server and Source Push, depending on whether you are debugging or not. This will make it much simpler to ensure you get the right behavior you want in production, while still being able to use the Chrome Dev Tools, live reload, etc. at debug-time.

      Your `sourceURLForBridge` method should look like this:

      ```objective-c
      - (NSURL *)sourceURLForBridge:(RCTBridge *)bridge
      {
        #if DEBUG
          return [[RCTBundleURLProvider sharedSettings] jsBundleURLForBundleRoot:@"index"];
        #else
          return [CodePush bundleURL];
        #endif
      }
      ```

   **If you're using Swift:**
   1. Open up the `AppDelegate.swift` file, and add an import statement for the Source Push headers:

      ```swift
      import CodePush
      ```

   2. Find the following line of code, which sets the source URL for bridge for production release:

      ```swift
      Bundle.main.url(forResource: "main", withExtension: "jsbundle")
      ```

   3. Replace it with this line:

      ```swift
      CodePush.bundleURL()
      ```

      Your `bundleUrl` method should look like this:

      ```swift
      override func bundleURL() -> URL? {
      #if DEBUG
         RCTBundleURLProvider.sharedSettings().jsBundleURL(forBundleRoot: "index")
      #else
         CodePush.bundleURL()
      #endif
      }
      ```

4. Add the Deployment key to `Info.plist`:

   To let the Source Push runtime know which deployment it should query for updates against, open your app's `Info.plist`
file and add a new entry named `CodePushDeploymentKey`, whose value is the key of the deployment you want to configure
this app against (like the key for the `Staging` deployment for the `FooBar` app). You can retrieve this value by running `srcpush deployment ls <appName> -k` in the Source Push CLI (the `-k` or `--displayKeys` flag is necessary since keys aren't displayed by default) or take in [Source Push UI](https://console.srcpush.com/applications) and copying the value of the `Key` column which corresponds to the deployment you want to use (see below). Note that using the deployment's name (like Staging) will not work.
That "friendly name" is intended only for authenticated management usage from the CLI, and not for public consumption within your app.

   In order to effectively make use of the `Staging` and `Production` deployments that were created along with your Source Push app, refer to the [multi-deployment testing](../README.md#multi-deployment-testing) docs below before actually moving your app's usage of Source Push into production.

   *Note: If you need to dynamically use a different deployment, you can also override your deployment key in JS code using [Code-Push options](./api-js.md#CodePushOptions)*

### HTTP exception domains configuration (iOS)

Source Push plugin makes HTTPS requests to the following domains:

- api.srcpush.com
- blob.srcpush.com

If you want to change the default HTTP security configuration for any of these domains, you have to define the [`NSAppTransportSecurity` (ATS)][ats] configuration inside your **Info.plist** file:

```xml
<plist version="1.0">
  <dict>
    <!-- ...other configs... -->

    <key>NSAppTransportSecurity</key>
    <dict>
      <key>NSExceptionDomains</key>
      <dict>
        <key>api.srcpush.com</key>
        <dict><!-- read the ATS Apple Docs for available options --></dict>
      </dict>
    </dict>

    <!-- ...other configs... -->
  </dict>
</plist>
```

Before doing anything, please [read the docs][ats] first.

### Code Signing setup

You can self sign bundles during release and verify its signature before installation of update. For more info about Code Signing please refer to [relevant Source Push documentation section](https://docs.srcpush.com).

In order to configure Public Key for bundle verification you need to add record in `Info.plist` with name `CodePushPublicKey` and string value of public key content. Example:

```xml
<plist version="1.0">
   <dict>
      <!-- ...other configs... -->

      <key>CodePushPublicKey</key>
      <string>-----BEGIN PUBLIC KEY-----
         MFwwDQYJKoZIhvcNAQEBBQADSwAwSAJBANkWYydPuyOumR/sn2agNBVDnzyRpM16NAUpYPGxNgjSEp0etkDNgzzdzyvyl+OsAGBYF3jCxYOXozum+uV5hQECAwEAAQ==
         -----END PUBLIC KEY-----</string>

      <!-- ...other configs... -->
   </dict>
</plist>
```
